The relationship between tasks and cores is established with spark.task.cpus and the overall core requirement for a stage is estimated as:
# No of Cores required for Stage = (# of Tasks required for Stage) * (spark.task.cpus)

Each Executor in Spark hosts either a single or multiple partitions and as a result either a single or multiple tasks during processing of a stage and the subsequent jobs associated with the code that was executed. The relationship between executors and cores, and as a result the relationship between executors and tasks, is driven with spark.executor.cores and can be established as:
# No of Executors required for Stage = (# of Cores required for Stage) / (spark.executor.cores)

#types
 -- Tiny executors
 -- Fat executors
 -- Balance between Fat & Tiny; The two main resources that Spark (and YARN) think about are CPU and memory.
